# SMS Spam Classifier

This project is an SMS Spam Classifier built using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and NLP techniques. It uses the UCI SMS Spam Collection dataset to train a machine learning model that can classify SMS messages as spam or not spam.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Model training using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Model evaluation and metrics
- Model serialization for deployment

## Dataset

The dataset used is the [UCI SMS Spam Collection](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection), which contains labeled SMS messages as "ham" (not spam) or "spam".
